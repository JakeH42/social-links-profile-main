## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- CSS calc
- BEM naming conventions

### What I learned

Getting better and knowing when to use utility classes instead of component styles

### Continued development

I feel I did quite well considering I had no figma file to use. Will learn more about clamp() in CSS for dynamic spacing and dynamically sized fonts.
